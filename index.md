## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">
My name is Xuan-Bach Le. I am currently a Research Scientist at RISE Lab, SMU, Singapore. You can find more infos about me [here](cv.pdf).

For a brief background, I was a NUS undergraduate student (2007-2012) studying Double-Degree Program in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics (a list of taken courses can be found [here](courses.html). After receiving two first-class bachelor's degrees in 2012, I officially (and seriously) began my research career as a CS PhD student in NUS (2013-2017) under the President Graduate Fellowship Scheme. During my PhD studies,I was supervised by [Aquinas Hobor](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hobor/) and mentored by [Anthony W. Lin](https://anthonywlin.github.io/).

## Research Interest

I am interested in both the practical applications and theoretical foundations of Computer Science. In particular, my research topics include (but are not limited to) developing logical frameworks/(certified) decision procedures for program verification, as well as establishing the decidability and computational complexity of the underlying logics.
