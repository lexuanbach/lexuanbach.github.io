  abstract: "Multi-intent detection and slot filling are fundamental tasks of natural language understanding in task-oriented dialog systems. Early approaches treated them as separate tasks, which undermines the direct connection between intents and their associated slots. This limitation becomes more pronounced when multiple intents are expressed within a single utterance.<br><br>In the Vietnamese language landscape, research on this topic remains limited, largely due to its low-resource status. To address this gap, we introduce <strong>VSLIM</strong>, a joint model designed for multi-intent detection and slot filling in Vietnamese. Inspired by the SLIM framework, VSLIM builds on its foundation with a biaffine classifier that more directly captures the relationship between intents and slots. This design allows the model to better understand and represent the dependencies across sequence labels in multi-intent settings.<br><br>Experiments on the Vietnamese <strong>PhoATIS</strong> dataset and our newly introduced <strong>VPED</strong> corpus show that VSLIM outperforms strong NLU baselines, highlighting its potential for improving Vietnamese task-oriented dialog systems.

  abstract: "Monadic decomposability — the ability to determine whether a formula in a given logical theory can be decomposed into a Boolean combination of monadic formulas — is a powerful tool for devising decision procedures. In this paper, we revisit a classical decision problem in automata theory: given a regular (synchronized rational) relation, determine whether it is recognizable, i.e., whether it admits a monadic decomposition as a Boolean combination of Cartesian products of regular languages.<br><br>Regular relations are highly expressive and, under suitable encodings, capture relations definable in Presburger Arithmetic. Their expressive power coincides with relations definable in universal automatic structures, equivalently those definable by finite set interpretations in WS1S (Weak Second Order Theory of One Successor).<br><br>While decidability of this problem was known (and exponential time for binary relations), its exact complexity remained open. Our main contribution is to fully settle the complexity of this decision problem by developing new techniques based on infinite Ramsey theory. We show that the problem is <strong>NLOGSPACE-complete</strong> for DFA representations and <strong>PSPACE-complete</strong> for NFA representations of regular relations."
